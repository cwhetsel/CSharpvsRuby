C#
> C# flirts with functional programming, but doesn't completely seal the deal
> Delegates look to be wrappers around instance methods. They create the profile of stand-alone functions, so that you can use them as such, rather than referring to object instances.
> C# supports lambdas and anonymous functions (a more verbose and featured version of lambdas), but that's as far as it goes into functional programming

Ruby

> Ruby supports functional programming.
> One of the most critical aspects to be able to program in a functional style is if the language supports higher order functions which Ruby does.
