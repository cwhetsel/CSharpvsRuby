### Why was the language created?

> C# was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto who wanted to create a object oriented scripting language. 

> He wanted the following features; Syntactically Simple, Truly Object-Oriented, Having Iterators and Closures, Exception Handling, Garbage Collection, and Portable.

### What problems was the language trying to address?
> The creator saw flaws in the other OO scripting languages at the time and wanted to make a better alternative.
    
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
> The creator saw Perl as a "toy" or dumbed down language and wanted to build something much more fully fleshed. He had worked with Python and but perceived that OO was an afterthought and not a core concept of the language. He thus didn't think it was a true object oriented language.
