### A Comparison of C# and Ruby functional programming features

  #### C#
  
  > C# is inheritently a OO language and doesn't support much in the way of functional programming, but it does allow for things such as parametric polymorphism, allows programmers to pass and returns functions as values for higher-order functions, and has limited support for anonymous delegates.
  > Although there is limited support for functional programming Microsoft also created F# to combine the power of .NET and functional programming in their product stack.
    
  #### Ruby
  
  > Ruby can be programmed in a functional style, although it is not enforced, it allows for high-order functions, real mathematical functions, and allows for programming without state.
